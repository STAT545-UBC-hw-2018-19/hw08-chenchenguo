# Homework 8: Making a shiny app
This is the repo for hw08-chenchenguo.
The aim of hw-08 is to add features to the BC liquor shiny app and deploy it.

Applied features:
  * Add an option to sort the results table by price
  * Add an image of the BC Liquor Store to the UI
  * Use the DT package to turn the current results table into an interactive table
  * Add parameters to the plot
  * Place the plot and the table in separate tabs
  * Experiment with packages that add extra features to Shiny
  * Show the number of results found whenever the filters change.
  * Allow the user to download the results table
  * Show a new input that allows the user to filter by sweetness level
  * Allow user to search for multiple alcohol types simutaneously, instead of being able to choose only wines/beers
  * Provide a way for the user to show results from all countries (instead of forcing a filter by only one specific country)
